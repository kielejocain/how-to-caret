# Data Modeling with Caret

This repo is intended for a talk given 11/18/2015 on the use of the `caret` package in the R language.  There are several ways to consume the presentation slides:

1. If you have `ipython` with the R kernel installed, simply run `ipython notebook` in the main folder and enjoy.
2. I have a working `gh-pages` branch: see [kielejocain.github.io/how-to-caret](http://kielejocain.github.io/how-to-caret)
3. You may pull the `.Rmd` file into R Studio and run it from there (it takes about 2 hours on my Mac Book Pro)
4. I've also knitted the `.Rmd` file into a `.pdf` for your offline enjoyment.

In addition, I hope to put together a few other example problems with data sets readily available in R packages like `caret` and `ggplot2`.
